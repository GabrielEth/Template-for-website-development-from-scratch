# Template-for-website-development-from-scratch
This repo was made from the tips and tricks provided by Jonas Schmedtmann and his "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" Udemy course.
The CSS elements contain design parameters to make your website look even and pleasent to the eye. 
This repo doesn't consider the use of frameworks and libraries to build a website, it's all about pure HTML, CSS, an JS.
